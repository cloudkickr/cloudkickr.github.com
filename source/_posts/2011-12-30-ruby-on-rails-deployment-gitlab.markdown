Cloudkickr is pleased to tell about its recent successful GitLab deployment. <a target="_blank" href="http://gitlabhq.com/">GitlabHQ</a> is for anyone managing project source code or interested in greater version-control and visibility with Git. Based on <a target="_blank" href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>, GitLab is a free git repository management app. It's your own lite app for projects/repositories hosting on your server. Moreover, it's fast, secure and a stable solution built straight off the <a target="_blank" href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> framework.

See a live demo of cloudkickr's deployment at <a href="https://git.cloudkickr.com" target="_blank">git.cloudkickr.com</a>. You'll probably need to accept the SSL certificate before your browser will display. To test the app use login "demo@cloudkickr.com" password "cloudkickr".
