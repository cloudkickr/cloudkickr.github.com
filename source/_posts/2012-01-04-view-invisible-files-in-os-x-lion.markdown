Cloudkickr's search engine is in Development through <a href="http://rubyonrails.org" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a>. Both Twitter and Groupon were built with Ruby on Rails. Our search engine architecture is designed for routekickr (the new site and app coming soon). <br/><br/>A search engine has three parts: Crawl, Index and Query. Crawl is powered by a server's proccessor similar to how your processor runs a web browser for retrieving content that you view in the browser window while you're surfing the internet. So the Crawl part of the search engine goes out and collects HTML pages for storage in the Index. The Query is what the end-user interacts with to find the relevent result stored in the index.
